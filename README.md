# My coding journey - Pygame platformer

This game is a two dimensional platformer, made as a scholarship application before heading off to study at Coder Academy Brisbane. It is made entirely by myself including all assets. This platformer was made in five days and I may have bitten off more than was comfortably chewable; regardless I grew, and tried out new concepts including:
- parralax
- side-scrolling
- pixel art
- storytelling

It does not perform as well as I would like and I feel that it is due to how I set up the side scrolling. I did it but I realise my logic is bad and
there is a much cleaner and more elegant way. I was centering everything around the window, it would be much better to think of it as the sprite moving through the
world and drawing the surface in his locale and then blitting that surface to the window as an afterthought. It was also the first time I used pyinstaller.

This game requires at least:
- python 3.8
- pygame 2.0.1

**N.B. This code is not beautiful, and the game is not endlessly scalable. It was more an exercise in telling my story and providing little sparks of wonder. This was made before I began study at Coder Academy Brisbane.**
