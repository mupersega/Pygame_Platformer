# My coding journey - Pygame platformer

Hi there, here is the code for the my coding journey game that I submitted for the Diversity in Tech scholarship.

I made this in five days, I learnt a whole lot and maybe bit off more than was chewable. Regardless I grew and tried out new concepts including:
  parralax
  side-scrolling
  pixel art
  storytelling

It does not perform as well as I would like and I feel that it is due to how I set up the side scrolling. I did it but I realise my logic is bad and
there is a much cleaner and more elegant way. I was centering everything around the window, it would be much better to think of it as the sprite moving through the
world and drawing the surface in his locale and then blitting that surface to the window as an afterthought. It was also the first time I used pyinstaller.

## Should you wish to run this code by all means DO
All you need is latest python and latest pygame.

N.B. This code is not beautiful, and the game is not endlessly scalable. It was more an exercise in telling my story and providing little sparks of wonder. This was made before I began study at Coder Academy Brisbane.
